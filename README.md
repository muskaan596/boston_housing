## Machine Learning project : Boston Housing Prices
This project applies basic machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home.

This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

Python 2.7
NumPy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn

Feature Observation:

The following behavioral trends are expected from the data:

RM : The prices increase with increase in the average number of rooms among homes in the neighborhood. Larger homes have higher prices.
LSTAT : Lower the LSTAT, higher should be the prices in the neighborhood ie. a lower LTSAT indicates people with higher incomes in the neighborhood as compared to others. More affluent families tend to have more expensive homes.
PTRATIO : Lower the studentt teacher ratio, higher the quality of education and therefore, the neighborhood would be more sought after and have a higher price.
